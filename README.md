# Game-Recommendation-System
A recommendation system for video games, which suggests gamers the best fit game for them based upon their choice and gaming-habit.

## Our Goal:
All three members of this project have an interest in video games. Our main objective of this project is to predict and recommend video games to users. Like some users might prefer Real Time Strategy games while some users prefer Single person shooting game. Entertainment in the form of video games is quite popular, but choosing a particular game which fits the gaming habit and interest of an individual can be a difficult. So, we chose this problem to recommend users video games based on some parameters, particularly some gaming habits and choice.
